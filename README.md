## FAQ

> Why not Chrome Web Store?

Well I'm broke, and it costs $20 for a dev account... 

> Firefox Add-ons link?

~~It's not available on Firefox's store yet, but they say it's free so maybe when I read the docs I will be able to make it public there!~~

Well it got accepted, the documentation is very clear. 24h and it got published to the public store!
